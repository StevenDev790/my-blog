        <h2 id="getting-started-title">Getting Started</h2>
        <h6> 11/7/2024</h6>
      <p id="getting-started-paragraph">  I started learning how to code on Khan Academy. At first, I wasn’t exactly sure which programming languages to focus on, but I knew I wanted to understand how computers and websites work. As I explored the lessons, I began experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, slowly building my confidence and skills. Even though I was just starting out, I was excited by the possibilities and wanted to keep learning more about the world of programming. </p>

        <h6> 12/23/2024</h6>
        
        <p id="took-a-long-break-paragraph"> At one point, I started to feel like coding was too hard for me to understand. Some of the concepts were confusing, and I didn’t know if I was making real progress. Because of that, I decided to take a break for a while and step away from it. During that time, I started thinking about why I wanted to learn coding in the first place, and eventually, that motivation brought me back to it with a fresh mindset and more determination to keep going. </p>

        <h2 id="continued-coding-title"> Continued coding </h2>
        <h6> 5/2/2025 </h6>
        <p id="continued-coding-paragraph">  Eventually, I came back to coding with a new mindset and decided to start fresh on a account—the one I’m using now. Starting over gave me a clean slate and a chance to track my progress more clearly. This time, I felt more motivated and focused than ever before. I began coding every day, building small projects, learning from my mistakes, and really enjoying the process of getting better step by step.
